well it only adds 1 block for now but you get the idea

## funnels

hoppers but like different

inserts items that contact their input end into the container at the output end if availible

works with chests crates drawers furnaces

they dont have an inventory so you cant insert into one

if powered they suck out a stack from any container at their output end and spit it out, possibly into another container

powered funnels stop pulling in items

hold shift while wrenching to swap to the opposite orientation
